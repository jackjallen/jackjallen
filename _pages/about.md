I’m a Research Fellow at University College London (UCL), working on T2 mapping of the human brain.

I also have an honorary Research Associate contract with Imperial College London (ICL) Department of Brain Sciences, specialising in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) physics. This follows my full-time position at ICL, where I was based at the Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) unit of the Royal Brompton Hospital (London, UK).

My interests include quantitative MRI parameter mapping and image shape analysis, as well as the interplay between medical imaging and artistic design.

I have studied Physics (MSci) at King’s College London and Biomedical Imaging (DPhil) at the University of Oxford.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
