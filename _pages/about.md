I’m a medical imaging researcher motivated to use quantitative techniques to improve healthcare. I'm also interested in the interplay between medical imaging and artistic design.

Currently, I'm a Research Fellow at [University College London](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/97450-jack-allen), working on brain MRI T2 mapping. Before this, I worked on cardiac MRI research at the [Royal Brompton Hospital](https://www.rbht.nhs.uk/our-services/heart/heart-assessment/cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-cmr-unit). I have also studied Physics (MSci) at King’s College London and Biomedical Imaging (DPhil) at the University of Oxford, including projects in fluorescence microscopy and cardiac shape analysis.

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:j.j.allen@hotmail.co.uk) if you have any queries or suggestions.
