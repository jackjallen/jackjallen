However, the fast and variable heart rate in these patients results in poor image quality. An existing dynamic-TI method varies inversion time on a beat-by-beat basis (according to the previous cardiac cycle length) to improve myocardial nulling, but blood signal variations are incompletely corrected and cause ghosting. We have developed an improved technique which bases the beat-by-beat TI on the history of RR intervals (rather than the previous one) and reduces blood signal variations while maintaining myocardial nulling. Simulations with patient RR interval distributions show significantly improved results.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The figure below shows an example of each method for a numerical phantom simulation, showing improved image clarity for the dynamic TI methods versus using a fixed TI. The ring represents a cross-section of myocardium around the blood pool. The small bright region represents myocardial scarring. The three images highlight that the new approach focuses on reducing image ghosting from the blood signal. Image intensity is shown in arbitrary units.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ISMRM2020abstract-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ISMRM2020abstract-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ISMRM2020abstract-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/ISMRM2020abstract.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> </div> </body></html>
