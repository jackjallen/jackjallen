	abstract = {Understanding myocardial remodelling, and developing tools for its accurate quantiﬁcation, is fundamental for improving the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction patients. Conventional clinical metrics, such as blood pool volume or ejection fraction, are not always distinctive. Here we describe a method for the classiﬁcation of myocardial infarction from 3D diastolic and systolic left ventricle shapes, represented by point sets. Classiﬁcation features included global geometric, shape and thickness descriptors, and a random forest was used for classiﬁcation. Results from cross validation show an accuracy of 92.5\% (leave-one-out) and 91.5\% (5-fold), improving the 87\% obtained with ejection fraction thresholds. These results suggest that reﬁned remodelling metrics provide information beyond standard clinical descriptors.},

@inproceedings{kukran_magnetisation_2023,
	title = {Magnetisation {Transfer} effects on {T1} and {T2} values in {MR} {Fingerprinting}},
	abstract = {Methods A FISP 2D cartesian MRF sequence with and
without off resonance pulses before every readout was developed in house with
varying flip angles and repetition times based on schedules reported by Jiang
et al5. After an adiabatic inversion pulse, a series of FISP
acquisitions were acquired with a sinusoidal variation of flip angles (FA) and
repetition times (TR) in a Perlin noise pattern. The FOV was 300 and the acquisition matrix was 128 x 128. 64 lines of k space per image were acquired
with GRAPPA-2 acceleration. A schematic of the pulse sequence is included in
Figure 1. A total of 828 contrasts with a slice
thickness of 5mm were acquired to reconstruct a timeseries of complex images. The
off-resonance pulse was 180° with a frequency offset of 2000Hz. Data acquisition with and without the
off-resonance pulses was performed on a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3 Tesla system
(Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen Germany). Initial investigations were performed
on the NIST phantom, a crosslinked bovine-serum
albumin (BSA) MT phantom, and in a single healthy volunteer as part of an
ethically approved study after obtaining informed consent.
A dictionary was generated using a single-pool
extended phase graph (EPG) model developed by Malik et al6 for T1
values 10-4500ms, T2 values 2-3000ms and B1+ values 0.8 to 1.2. To
incorporate slice profile effects7-9 the effective imaging flip
angle was simulated for each prescribed sinc RF pulse and slice selection
gradient profile to generate fingerprints at 11 discrete points across the 5mm
imaging slice, which were then summed and normalised for matching. The B1
was preselected via comparison to a Siemens turbo-flash map. Fingerprints for
every voxel were extracted and matched to the closest dictionary entry using a maximum
dot product search, and corresponding T1 and T2 maps were reconstructed.
Results and Discussion In Figure 2, signal evolutions for single
voxels acquired with and without off resonance in all three scanning subjects
are shown. No magnetisation transfer takes place in the liquid NIST phantom
because only free protons are present. In all other voxels, off-resonance pulses saturate bound protons and areas with significant bound and free proton
interactions, reducing the signal magnitude as only free protons are measured. This
also changes the shape of the signal evolution, and leads to different matches
for normalised fingerprints, as shown in Figure 3. The resulting T1 and T2 maps are shown in Figures
4 and 5 respectively. In this experiment, applying off resonance pulses
throughout the acquisition caused the observed T1 to decrease. This behaviour
was unexpected and opposite to what was observed in our previous experiment4.
It is also in the opposite direction to changes in T1 observed when MT effects on a fingerprinting acquisition were
simulated explicitly by Hilbert et al10. T2 values increased when off-resonance pulses were
applied. this is similar to what was observed when MT effects were simulated explicitly10.

	abstract = {Purpose
Variable heart rate during single-cycle inversion-recovery Late Gadolinium-Enhanced (LGE) scanning degrades image quality, which can be mitigated using Variable Inversion Times (VTIs) in real-time response to R-R interval changes. We investigate in vivo and in simulations an extension of a single-cycle VTI method previously applied in 3D LGE imaging, that now fully models the longitudinal magnetisation (fmVTI).
Methods
The VTI and fmVTI methods were used to perform 3D LGE scans for 28 3D LGE patients, with qualitative image quality scores assigned for left atrial wall clarity and total ghosting. Accompanying simulations of numerical phantom images were assessed in terms of ghosting of normal myocardium, blood, and myocardial scar.
Results
The numerical simulations for fmVTI showed a significant decrease in blood ghosting (VTI: 410 ± 710, fmVTI: 68 ± 40, p {\textless} 0.0005) and scar ghosting (VTI: 830 ± 1300, fmVTI: 510 ± 730, p {\textless} 0.02). Despite this, there was no significant change in qualitative image quality scores, either for left atrial wall clarity (VTI: 2.0 ± 1.0, fmVTI: 1.8 ± 1.0, p {\textgreater} 0.1) or for total ghosting (VTI: 1.9 ± 1.0, fmVTI: 2.0 ± 1.0, p {\textgreater} 0.7).
Conclusions
Simulations indicated reduced ghosting with the fmVTI method, due to reduced Mz variability in the blood signal. However, other sources of phase-encode ghosting and blurring appeared to dominate and obscure this finding in the patient studies available.},
