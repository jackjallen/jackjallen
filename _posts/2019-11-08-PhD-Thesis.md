In the summer of 2019, I finished my PhD in Biomedical Imaging at the University of Oxford.  I worked in the physics group at the Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), aiming to develop fast and reliable quantitative MRI-based in vivo measurements of magnetisation relaxation parameters T1 and T2.

Thesis title: “An Optimisation Framework for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting“.
